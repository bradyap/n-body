The startcode includes:
- Clearly marked placeholders for serial, `std::thread`, and OpenMP versions,
- Timing sections using `std::chrono`.

Notes:

- Start by verifying the serial version works correctly.
- Add a std::thread version (manual threading).
- Add an OpenMP version
- Record timing results for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 threads.
- Report speedup and efficiency in your write-up
- Include code snippets, plots, and a brief discussion in your presentation.
